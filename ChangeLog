	- {pim6dd,pim6sd}/{mld6.c, netlink.c}:
	    assign sin6_scope-id on linux as well as in KAME
	    (contributed by USAGI Project)
	- pim6sd/config.c, pim6dd/config.c, mcastsend/mcastsend.c, mtrace6/mtrace6.c
	    prevent a NULL pointer access in Linux.  (getifaddrs() returns
	    an ifa with ifa->ifa_addr=NULL for pim6reg interface)
	    (contributed by USAGI Project)
	- {pim6dd,pim6sd}/routesock.c
	    fixed a compilation failure on linux, and stop supporting OSes
	    without routing-socket or netlink.
	    (suggested by USAGI Project)

May 1 2008	suz@kame.net
	- include/linux/*, configure, configure.in, include/config.h.in,
	  pim6sd/Makefile, pim6sd/Makefile.am, pim6sd/Makefile.in, pim6sd/config.c,
	  pim6sd/debug.c, pim6sd/main.c, pim6sd/mld6.c, pim6sd/mld6.h, pim6sd/mrt.c,
	  pim6sd/netlink.c pim6sd/pim6.c, pim6sd/pim6_proto.c, pim6sd/route.c,
	  pim6sd/routesock.c, pim6sd/rp.c:
	    pim6sd supports linux now (experimental).
	    IPv6-multicast-aware linux kernel is available from USAGI Project 
	    or the latest 2.6 snapshot.  (contributed by USAGI Project)
	- pmsft/pmsft.c, mtrace6/mtrace6.c: removed a compilation warning.
		
Apr 7 2008	suz@kame.net
	- mtrace6.c: use "struct in6_ifreq" only when SIOCGIFAFLAG_IN6 is available.
	  (contributed by USAGI Project)
	- mtrace6.c: use "fd_set", instead of "struct fd_set", to support OSes
	  without "struct fd_set".
	  (contributed by USAGI Project)
	- mtrace6: added mld6.h to support OSes without struct mld_hdr {}.
	  (contributed by USAGI Project)
	- configure.in: added an knob to choose applications to be build.
	  (contributed by USAGI Project)

Dec 4 2006	suz@kame.net
	- pim6sd: fixed a compilation failure on netbsd (with gcc-4.1.2)

Sep 20 2006	suz@kame.net
	- pim6sd: supports GenID option
	- mfc: sleep a while to prevent a CPU overload.
	- mfc: provides a lower TTL threshold for IPv4 multicast routing to prevent
	       an unexpected multicast routing failure. (*BSD kernel does not generate
	       any error for TTL threshold violation)

Jun 24 2006	suz@kame.net
	- pmsft: build pmsft regardless of the existence of MLDv2-host functionality
	  (if MLDv2-host functionality is not available, only MLDv1-join/leave would
	   work)

Mar 21 2006	suz@kame.net
	- pim6sd: supports DR-priority option

Mar 17 2006	suz@kame.net
	- fixed a pim6sd crash when it receives an (*,G) join for SSM-range 
	  prefix (ff3x::/96)

Dec 10 2005	suz@kame.net
	- fixed a compilation failure of yacc/lex files on netbsd

Dec 08 2005	suz@kame.net
	- fixed a bug that pim6sd/pim6dd does not start on non-RFC3542 OS

Oct 23 2005	suz@kame.net
	- pim6sd prefers the longest-match entry in static-MRIB search,
	  instead of the first-match one.

Oct 06 2005	suz@kame.net
	- fixed a bug that pim6sd cannot specify static MRIB using link-local
	  nexthop
	- pim6sd skips a hello option 24/65001 with an unknown address family,
	  instead of discarding the whole hello message.

Sep 23 2005	suz@kame.net
	- fixed a availability check failure of RFC3542 on freebsd4
	- moved the location of configuration file from /etc to /usr/local/etc
	- fixed a pim6sd crash when it does not have an upstream router for 
	  the RP address embedded in MLD report message.

Sep 21 2005	suz@kame.net
	- automatically checks the availability of RFC3542 or RFC2292.
	- automatically checks the availability of routing-socket or netlink
	- added a netlink-based routing for pim6sd and pim6dd

Sep 20 2005	suz@kame.net
	- "configure --disable-mldv2" works properly
	- separated the mldv2 configure option into two: host-side mldv2 and router-side mldv2.
	- checks the existence of "struct mld_hdr" in configure script, and define it locally if necessary.
	- checks the existence of "netinet6/pim6.h" and "netinet6/in6_var.h" in configure script

Sep 16 2005	suz@kame.net
	- make mcastread and mcastsend compilable on linux
	- pim6sd supports embedded-RP

Sep 10 2005	suz@kame.net
	- supports OS without length field for sockaddr* (e.g. linux)
	- prefer to using strlcpy() to strncpy() whereever possible.
	- in linux, use linux/mroute6.h instead of netinet6/ip6_mroute.h

Sep 8 2005	suz@kame.net
	- supports autoconf
	- moved mtrace6 from pim6sd/mtrace6 to top-directory

Sep 3 2005	suz@kame.net
	- initial version
		- use configure script
